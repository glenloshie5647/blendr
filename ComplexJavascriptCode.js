/**
 * This code is an implementation of a complex and sophisticated JavaScript application
 * that simulates a virtual reality environment with a 3D maze for navigation.
 *
 * The code uses WebGL for rendering the maze and Three.js library for 3D graphics,
 * and incorporates physics simulations and user input handling for a realistic experience.
 *
 * The maze is generated dynamically using a procedural algorithm, and the user can navigate
 * through it using the arrow keys or WASD keys. There are also objects in the maze that can be
 * interacted with, such as collecting items or triggering events.
 *
 * This code showcases advanced programming techniques and includes multiple classes, complex
 * functions, and various design patterns for organizing the codebase.
 *
 * NOTE: This code is intended to be executed in a browser environment with WebGL support.
