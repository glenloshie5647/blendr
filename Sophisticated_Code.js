Description: 
This code demonstrates a complex and sophisticated algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a famous NP-hard problem in computer science and optimization. The algorithm implemented here is based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) principle. It uses a colony of virtual ants to find the optimal route between a set of cities.

Note: This code has been heavily optimized and may not be easy to understand at first glance. However, it showcases advanced programming techniques such as dynamic programming, heuristic functions, and probabilistic algorithms.
